                    <h3>Description of Elden Ring</h3> 
                    <p><strong>Elden Ring</strong> is an epic action RPG developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. Released in 2022, this game stands out for its challenging gameplay, rich lore, and expansive open-world exploration.</p> 
                    <p>Set in the mystical Lands Between, the story begins with the shattering of the great Elden Ring. This event, known as the Shattering, was triggered by the Night of the Black Knives, when Godwyn the Golden, a demigod and Marika's offspring, was the first to perish. Following this, the demigods claimed the shards of the Elden Ring, resulting in a war that left the realm in ruins.</p> 
                    <p>Now, Queen Marika the Eternal has disappeared, and the land is in chaos. The player, known as a Tarnished, is called upon to cross the fog and stand before the Elden Ring to become the Elden Lord.</p> 
                    <p>As with other games by FromSoftware, <em>Elden Ring</em> is known for its punishing yet rewarding gameplay. Players must master the combat mechanics and explore every corner of the vast world to uncover its secrets and progress through the story.</p>
