                <p>My pet dog is called Lùn, or Smol if you preferred something more English. He had stayed with me for 4+ years but sadly passed away in August, 2023.</p>
                <p>He was a good dog, definitely not the smartest one out there but a very compassionate one. He was very clingy to me, following me everywhere I go.</p>
                <p>Every time I sit in my table, Lùn lied down near my legs, easy for cuddling. Every time I go to bed, he always slept nearby so that he could always be the one to meet me first when I woke up.</p>
