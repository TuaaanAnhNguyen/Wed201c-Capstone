                <p><strong>The Final Stand 2</strong> is a one among millions of "experiences", user-created content, on Roblox.</p>
                <p>In <em>The Final Stand 2</em>, players must defend a shop that sells weapons, necessary tools or even allows the players to hire mercenaries for survival during the apocalypse. The goal is to fortify the shop and ward off hordes of zombies that attack every time the night comes.</p>
                <p>Every night, hordes of zombies will come out, growing more numerous and stronger as the game progresses. Every 5th night (Night 5, 10, 15 and so on), a boss appears right at midnight, and these nights last significantly longer, making survival even more difficult. However, when the dawn breaks, the surviving zombies burn up in sunlight.</p>
                <p>Every time a player kills or damages a zombie, he will be rewarded with cash, which can be spent to buy, upgrade weapons or equipments or to buy shop upgrades that includes building a wall, increasing each surviving night cash income or hiring mercenaries.</p>
                <p>If you are looking for a game that is about both "defending your fortress" kind of vibe and zombie shooting, then <strong>The Final Stand 2</strong> is a game I would recommend trying out by clicking on the image above.</p>
